        Nightmare Woods is a one-player board game about a main character who is experiencing an emotional breakdown and goes for a walk through the woods to cope, allowing some degree of player choice while also conveying the helpless state of a mental breakdown. While this assignment was not polished to the degree I would have liked due to my medical issues throughout the semester, the files included represent a rough working draft.

        Beep is a simple piece of interactive fiction made using Inform 7. You awaken in a mysterious patch of grass with no idea where you are or why you're there. You hear a foreboding beeping noise in the background...

        Blank is a piece of interactive fiction made in Twine (Harlowe). It places the player in the perspective of an amnesiac with no memories or sense of identity. Player choice impacts which one of three people in the main character's life (all with vastly different relationships to them) they begin to rediscover their identity with, various dialogue and narrative beats, and the tone of the ending. It is currently a work in progress, currently including over 25K words and utilizing various twine features, such as complex variables. It will be actively updated as progress is made.
